# Bring An Umbrella  

What are you, stupid? Bring an umbrella.   

BAU wants to make your life easier. Tell it your zip code and it will send you an email or a text or whatever at the beginning of the day telling you whether or not you'll need an umbrella that day. Do you go outside a lot? Fancy britches over here with their nice outside job? Enter in a timeframe you'll be outside and Bring an Umbrella will let you know if you need that sweet, sweet 'brell.   

Outside of the US? That sucks. International functionality will be added later. Maybe.  

Uses Wunderground API and a bunch of sassiness.
